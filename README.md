## Process
The development of the Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard began with data collection, where raw patient data was gathered from hospital records. This was followed by data cleaning and preparation, which involved removing duplicates, correcting errors, and formatting data consistently. Next, pivot tables were created to summarize key information such as total patient count, departmental visits, gender distribution, admission status, and treatment timing. These summaries enabled meaningful data analysis, where important metrics like average wait time, age group distribution, and satisfaction scores were calculated. The dashboard design stage involved visualizing this data through charts, graphs, and KPI indicators to present insights clearly and effectively. To enhance user experience, interactivity and filters such as slicers for month, department, and admission status were added for dynamic data viewing. Afterward, the dashboard underwent review and testing to ensure data accuracy and functional performance.
